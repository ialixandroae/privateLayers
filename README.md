This application was designed to test and implement the OAuth functionality with an ArcGIS Online account to grant privileges and permissions to the user.
The application starts with a standar map with no layers and an upper-right Log In button; the user will log in and after the application will display another map with a real time traffic layer and some basic widgets: legend and click-to-get-coordinates; also, a Log Out functionality was implemented which returns the user to the start map.
