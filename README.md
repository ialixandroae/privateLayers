# OAuth Web Application

This application was designed to test and implement the OAuth functionality with an ArcGIS Online account to grant privileges and permissions to the user.
The application starts with a standar map with no layers and an upper-right Log In button; the user will log in and after the application will display another map with a real time traffic layer and some basic widgets: legend and click-to-get-coordinates; also, a Log Out functionality was implemented which returns the user to the start map.
